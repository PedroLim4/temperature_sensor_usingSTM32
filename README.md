# # üå°Ô∏è Temperature Sensor with STM32

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a temperature monitoring system using an **STM32 microcontroller**. The primary objective was to apply concepts of digital and analog electronics, along with embedded systems programming, to create a functional solution for acquiring and displaying real-time temperature data, as well as alternating LEDs when the light is turned on and off.
